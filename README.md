## 👋 Hi there 

I'm ✨**Jocelyn**✨ a tech-driven problem solver with a background in applied mathematics, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure. I build data-powered solutions that range from real-time fraud detection to NLP pipelines. I'm currently expanding my expertise in MLOps and Generative AI, and I’m always curious about how we can push technology further (ethically and practically).
